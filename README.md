# bullet-train-NodeApp

This has no to relation with any organization/business, it is just an webapp I am developing based on the bullet train that will be built between Houston and Dallas.

Server-side rendered application using MEN to implement a RESTful API, while using PUG template to render my webpages so the user can interact with the application, which retrieves data from a cloud-hosted database on MongoDB Atlas.
