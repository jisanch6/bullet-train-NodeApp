To view deployed version of applicaton please go to: https://bullet-train-jisanch6.herokuapp.com/
The front-end application does not implement all the features that the back-end of the application is capable of.
To view the full capabilities and understand how the back-end works please review my postman documentation at:

This has no to relation with any organization/business, it is just an webapp I am developing based on the bullet train that will be built between Houston and Dallas.

Server-side rendered application using MEN to implement a RESTful API, while using PUG template to render my webpages so the user can interact with the application, which retrieves data from a cloud-hosted database on MongoDB Atlas.
